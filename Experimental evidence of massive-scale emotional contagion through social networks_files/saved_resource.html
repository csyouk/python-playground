This is possible. The authors of this paper may very well have done everything within the legal rules. But the paper is not within the spirit of the ethical principals behind the rules. This paper seems to have worked it\u2019s way through the system via a series of\nloopholes. Facebook is not under the same ethical obligations of academia, so it conducted the research. The Cornell IRB then determined that they have no jurisdiction over the research. So then the paper came to PNAS and PNAS failed the one opportunity this work had for ethical scrutiny. What is puzzling to me is that the paper clearly does not meet the rules for HSR that PNAS outlines in their author policies. There was no IRB because Facebook conducted the research and does not have an IRB. The paper says there was informed consent (informed consent is a required journal policy) but the \u201cinformed consent\u201d in the paper does not match any definition of informed consent that others might use. PNAS\npolicies clearly indicate that this work should not have been published, but for some reason they published it anyway.\n\nThere are still so many questions about this work that remain:\n-What role did the Cornell authors have in design pre-collection?\n-Why did PNAS ignore their journal policies?\n-Were minors included in the study (the paper has a puzzling lack of demographic data)?\n-What other similar work has Facebook done that is still in peer review somewhere?\n\nOne of my big concerns is that left unchecked, other work will appear that takes advantage of similar legal loopholes as are present in this study. By publishing the paper despite the violation of journal policies this seems to set a stage that may encourage more work wit similar flaws.\n\nIt is damaging to all researchers who work with human participants when studies take place which reduce public trust in the system. How many people do you think feel inspired to participate in psychological research after reading about this work? \n\nI think people are well informed that Facebook lacks solid privacy values. But there is a huge distinction between engaging with Facebook with the knowledge that I place some privacy at risk and being an unwitting participant in experimental (aka non-observational) psychological research.\n\nI worry that research without adequate informed consent will create distrust towards psychological research among the general public. Providing informed consent is a part of showing respect for the rights of participants who volunteer their time to help science. If people don't feel researchers have this respect for them, I worry it may make people less\ncomfortable with the idea of participating in research. The potential impact of condoning this work may have ripple effects that harm the field as a whole.","isApproved":true,"isSpam":false,"thread":"2815943045","depth":0,"numReports":0,"createdAt":"2014-07-04T21:45:47","isEdited":false,"message":"\u003cp>It's hard to know where to start here.\u003c/p>\u003cp>I think one place to begin is the unique situation commentary on this study is in.

The paper says there was informed consent (informed consent is a required journal policy) but the \u201cinformed consent\u201d in the paper does not match any definition of informed consent that others might use. PNAS\u003cbr>policies clearly indicate that this work should not have been published, but for some reason they published it anyway.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There are still so many questions about this work that remain:\u003cbr>-What role did the Cornell authors have in design pre-collection?\u003cbr>-Why did PNAS ignore their journal policies?\u003cbr>-Were minors included in the study (the paper has a puzzling lack of demographic data)?\u003cbr>-What other similar work has Facebook done that is still in peer review somewhere?\u003c/p>\u003cp>One of my big concerns is that left unchecked, other work will appear that takes advantage of similar legal loopholes as are present in this study. By publishing the paper despite the violation of journal policies this seems to set a stage that may encourage more work wit similar flaws.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is damaging to all researchers who work with human participants when studies take place which reduce public trust in the system. How many people do you think feel inspired to participate in psychological research after reading about this work?\u003c/p>\u003cp>I think people are well informed that Facebook lacks solid privacy values. But there is a huge distinction between engaging with Facebook with the knowledge that I place some privacy at risk and being an unwitting participant in experimental (aka non-observational) psychological research.\u003c/p>\u003cp>I worry that research without adequate informed consent will create distrust towards psychological research among the general public. Providing informed consent is a part of showing respect for the rights of participants who volunteer their time to help science. If people don't feel researchers have this respect for them, I worry it may make people less\u003cbr>comfortable with the idea of participating in research.

Whatever one's views of the ethics of this study, no one is served by premising that discussion on incorrect assertions about the applicable law. (Note: the law in other countries where \nEnglish-speaking Facebook users were subjects, and the ethics of the \nstudy both here and abroad, are separate matters, neither of which I discuss here.) \n\nTo begin, it is not true that \"The common rule does not apply to this case, as it can only be applied to US Government research activities.\" The Common Rule, including the requirement of IRB review, applies by law [including the terms of the federal regulations themselves and contractual agreements entered into between institutions and the federal government] much more broadly than that. Non-exempt human subjects research must legally comply with the Common Rule when it is: (1) conducted by any of 15 federal agencies and departments, (2) funded by any of those agencies and departments, (3) conducted as part of an FDA application to market a drug, device, or biological [technically not the Common Rule but the FDA's nearly identical regulations], or (4) conducted by a student or faculty member of a college or university that, in the process of at some point accepting a federal research grant for some research project, has agreed by contract with the federal government to submit to IRB review ALL human subjects research in which the institution is \"engaged.\" \n\nEarly rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, this research was neither conducted nor funded by the federal government. However, the two academic authors were during the time of the study affiliates of Cornell (see correction to the PNAS paper clarifying this), which is among those institutions that has agreed to extend IRB review to all human subjects research in which it, Cornell, is \"engaged.\" When an institution is and is not \"engaged in research\" by virtue of their affiliates' participation in a research projects depends on what, exactly, those affiliates did. The regulations themselves do not define \"engaged in research,\" but those in charge of overseeing those regulations have issued a guidance document on this point (which Cornell has adopted), the best interpretation of which is that an institution whose affiliates help design the protocol and write up the results for publication but do not obtain data about the subjects through intervention, do not obtain identifiable private information about the subjects, and do not consent subjects  is NOT \"engaged in research.\" Hence, Cornell's IRB was not required by the federal regulations (or, it would seem, by its own internal policy) to review this study. And Facebook is not subject to these regulations at all. As a result, U.S. law did not require any IRB review of this study. (Yes, PNAS has its own policy concerning IRB review and informed consent, but that's not a matter of law, which is what I'm focusing on here.) \n\nMoreover, despite what you imply, it is not the case -- and has never been the case since HHS first promulgated these regulations in 1981 (adopted by the 14 other federal agencies in 1991) -- that all human subjects research that is subject to IRB review must involve the informed consent of the subjects. Lots of important research cannot be done with fully informed consent. As a result, the Common Rule has an entire subsection, 45 CFR 46.116(c)-(d), devoted to explaining when an IRB may alter the elements of informed consent that are ordinarily required and when it may waive the informed consent requirements entirely. IRBs notoriously make different decisions about the acceptability of similar and even identical protocols, and the \"minimal risk\" criterion at issue in 46.116(d) is especially susceptible to different interpretations, but an IRB very plausibly could have determined that this study involved minimal risk and qualified for altered, if not waived, informed consent.\n\nFinally, although it is orthogonal to any discussion of the Facebook study, the poster below, technik1, is incorrect about how U.S. federal regulators and IRBs tend to treat blood draws. The agency in charge of overseeing the Common Rule once issued a helpful \u201cIRB Guidebook\u201d (see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/irb/irb_chapter3.htm) which specifically cites \"the risk of drawing a small amount of blood from a healthy individual\" as an example of \u201cminimal risk\u201d research. Although that IRB Guidebook was last updated in 1993, and readers today are warned that \u201c[d]evelopments over the intervening years have made portions of the Guidebook information obsolete, while portions of the information remain valid,\u201d most U.S. IRBs continue to interpret single (or \u201cminimal\u201d) blood draws in healthy adults, and even sometimes in children, as minimal risk. See, e.g., http://www.research.umn.edu/irb/risk.html#.U7cC1Kjeyec;\nhttps://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/bldsamp.htm; and\nhttps://www.nwhealth.edu/institutional-review-board/which-forms-to-use/.\n In 2013, the U.S. Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues issued a report describing drawing blood in children as \"minimal risk.\" See http://bioethics.gov/sites/default/files/PCSBI_Pediatric-MCM508.pdf (at p. 68).\n\nI provide a more detailed analysis of how U.S. federal human subjects research regulations apply to this study, including citations to primary source documents, at http://www.wired.com/2014/06/everything-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-manipulative-experiment/.\n\nMichelle N.

<p>I am writing to express ethical concerns not only about the research by Kramer,<br>Guillory, and Hancock, but about the “Editorial Expression of Concern” that<br>PNAS published some days after the article appeared.</p><p>First, the Expression of Concern seems to miss the point that the research was not about<br>privacy per se, but specifically about informed consent in a situation that<br>involved more than minimal risk to the human participants. The research<br>involved an experimental manipulation of the news feeds of Facebook users, and<br>the manipulation had the possibility of affecting the users’ emotions.<br>Participants were not informed of the study and its risks in such a way as to<br>allow them to opt out if they so chose. Indeed, they were not informed of the<br>study at all. It is false of the authors to say, as they did in the article,<br>that the study “was consistent with Facebook’s Data Use Policy, to which all<br>users agree prior to creating an account on Facebook” and that this constituted<br>“informed consent for this research.” Nothing in the Policy mentions the<br>possibility of experimental research involving more than minimal risk. Users<br>may agree for their data to be used in "research," but they do not<br>specifically agree to be subject to experimental manipulations, because this<br>possibility is not even mentioned in the Policy. Neither is the additional<br>possibility that the procedures of the study might pose some harm.</p><p>Second, according to the Expression of Concern, the IRB at Cornell University declined<br>to review the ethical issues involved in the study “because it was conducted by<br>Facebook, Inc. for internal purposes.” If this is the case, the Cornell IRB and<br>PNAS were both in error. Two of the three authors of the study were affiliated<br>with Cornell and subject to IRB review. In addition, the research was not “internal”<br>at all, but was published in a scientific journal. It is absurd for PNAS to<br>stress that it conforms to the Common Rule regarding informed consent, and then<br>to say that it waives the rule if the research is conducted by a private<br>company, no questions asked.</p><p>In sum, the Expression of Concern does not go far enough. It should state firmly that<br>informed consent procedures essential to the safe and respectful treatment of<br>human participants were violated by the researchers in the study, that the<br>violation was overlooked by PNAS.</p>

<p>Apart from the ethical concerns of this study, should we maybe also be a little bit concerned about the actual science in it? Like the minuscule effects being reported as some pervasive emotional contagion or the archaic sentiment analysis? After all, is it not a moot point to argue whether any substantial harm was done to anyone, given the &lt; .1% of "mood" changes? <a href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/06/23/emotional-contagion-on-facebook-more-like-bad-research-methods/" rel="nofollow">http://psychcentral.com/blog/a...</a></p>

<p>The study was unethical. People have the legal right to know if they were used,  and what data was gathered about them if they were. They have the right to have their information/data removed from the study. They also had the right to be debriefed. And debriefing is where the most critical ethics violations occurred. Counseling should have been made available to anyone negatively affected by the experiment. <br>Also, how can this article be published as a serious experiment when the population of FB is a skewed population to begin with? Emotionally disabled people have far more time to spend on FB. What checks and balances were considered? Were emotionally and mentally disabled people included in the study? How many of those experimented on deal with depression? Anger? Rage? How many incidents, during that time of testing, were there of increased drug abuse, physical violence, suicidal thoughts and/or suicides?<br>I too would be open to a class action law suit.</p>

<p>Mark,</p><p>Yours sounds like a happy company to work for. What is your response to the published proceedings? (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/29/facebook-doesnt-understand-the-fuss-about-its-emotion-manipulation-study/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/sites/ka...</a>.  Do you think the psychological impact for Facebook users justifies signing up to clinical trials data? I can only say if you are prepared to let the public share openly in the results of the vexed issue, as clearly many are not so happy - at least we could put up our hand and say FB is completely transparent in its mission.</p>

<p>Let's say:  Someone is already living in a primarily negative setting, say that person may even be suicidal. Then say that this person is subject to primarily negative input via this experiment. Pretend said person slides over the edge and commits suicide.... Are these scientists then responsible directly or indirectly for that suicide?  Hmmm... nearly 700,000 people taking part without their knowledge.. I wonder how many suicides there are in a typical day amongst a population of 700,000 people... I wonder what a lawyer would have to say.</p>

<p>Everyone's response to this has been to pass the buck. Cornell said it <br>wasn't their responsibility because Facebook was a private company, and <br>now PNAS says Cornell's disavowal of responsibility somehow also clears <br>them of any wrongdoing. It's atrocious, and speaks to a kind of moral <br>cowardice previously unseen in my experience. As far as I can tell, PNAS<br> has no ethical integrity.</p>

<p>The PNAS position is as unethical as the original work. Cornell claimed the work did not fall under its jurisdiction. That does not make it ethical. Fbk's user agreement does NOT constitute informed consent since it does not specify the risks of the particular study. Anyone can do research but as scientific community we have agreed NOT to sanction and publish such research if it does not conform to the ethical guidelines that we have agreed on. PNAS policy states as much. So why does PNAS not even adhere to its own policy? Hypocritical and unethical. Shameful.</p>

<p>It's hard to know where to start here.</p><p>I think one place to begin is the unique situation commentary on this study is in. Anyone who used Facebook during the described time was potentially a subject in the study. My choice of the word “subject” here rather than the more politically correct “participant” is<br>intentional. The individuals included in this study were subjected to the study rather than participating in it of their own volition. This creates an interesting place for any commentary I have on the study. I am a researcher and have a set of professionally based opinions about the present study, but I may also be one of the subjects described in the study. For all the Facebook users, we are in a way a bunch of “schrodinger's research subjects”. No one knows if they were in the study or not. When PNAS hears the backlash against the study they should consider it in the light that some of the backlash is from potential subjects who are unhappy with their possible inclusion in a study that they did not ask to take part in.</p><p>Informed consent was the issue that first stood out to me about this research.</p><p>The authors state:<br>“As such, it was consistent with Facebook’s Data Use Policy, to which all users agree prior to creating an account on Facebook, constituting informed consent for this research”</p><p>There are points about the controversy in this study which can be debated, but I think the clearest issue is that in no way do the methods described here match any definition of informed consent.</p><p>If PNAS decides to take a bare minimum of action it should be to correct this inaccurate statement in the paper.</p><p>You can argue that maybe this study could have had been eligible for a waiver of informed consent. This is possible. The authors of this paper may very well have done everything within the legal rules. But the paper is not within the spirit of the ethical principals behind the rules. This paper seems to have worked it’s way through the system via a series of<br>loopholes. Facebook is not under the same ethical obligations of academia, so it conducted the research. The Cornell IRB then determined that they have no jurisdiction over the research. So then the paper came to PNAS and PNAS failed the one opportunity this work had for ethical scrutiny. What is puzzling to me is that the paper clearly does not meet the rules for HSR that PNAS outlines in their author policies. There was no IRB because Facebook conducted the research and does not have an IRB. The paper says there was informed consent (informed consent is a required journal policy) but the “informed consent” in the paper does not match any definition of informed consent that others might use. PNAS<br>policies clearly indicate that this work should not have been published, but for some reason they published it anyway.</p><p>There are still so many questions about this work that remain:<br>-What role did the Cornell authors have in design pre-collection?<br>-Why did PNAS ignore their journal policies?<br>-Were minors included in the study (the paper has a puzzling lack of demographic data)?<br>-What other similar work has Facebook done that is still in peer review somewhere?</p><p>One of my big concerns is that left unchecked, other work will appear that takes advantage of similar legal loopholes as are present in this study. By publishing the paper despite the violation of journal policies this seems to set a stage that may encourage more work wit similar flaws.</p><p>It is damaging to all researchers who work with human participants when studies take place which reduce public trust in the system. How many people do you think feel inspired to participate in psychological research after reading about this work?</p><p>I think people are well informed that Facebook lacks solid privacy values. But there is a huge distinction between engaging with Facebook with the knowledge that I place some privacy at risk and being an unwitting participant in experimental (aka non-observational) psychological research.</p><p>I worry that research without adequate informed consent will create distrust towards psychological research among the general public. Providing informed consent is a part of showing respect for the rights of participants who volunteer their time to help science. If people don't feel researchers have this respect for them, I worry it may make people less<br>comfortable with the idea of participating in research. The potential impact of condoning this work may have ripple effects that harm the field as a whole.</p>

<p>Absolutely spot on, Lee.</p><p>The unethical, immoral way in which this study was conducted invalidates not only the study, but casts aspersion on the psychological testing community in general.</p><p>There are solid reasons for informed consent. Does no one remember what happened with Milgram's obedience studies?</p><p>Those who carried this out must be held accountable, and their attempts a diverting blame should be called out for the immature irresponsibility it is.</p>

<p>I find it incredible that it is necessary to point out to you the serious ethical<br>problems with this “study”.  Not only was there no informed consent by the<br>subjects but the study fails to meet any of the relevant ethical guidelines,<br>including the Tri-Council Policy, the APA ethical principles, or any<br>others.  Claiming that the internal policies of a private corporation<br>(Facebook’s user policies which are rarely read by the user and have been<br>subject to legal action already) constitutes informed consent is false and<br>opens the researcher and supporting institutions to legal liability.  This entire study was contrary to every principle of legal and ethical research.</p>

<p>Apart from the heated debate over the ethical appropriateness of the experiment, I believe the way the authors interpreted the findings is another matter of concern. These findings could be interpreted alternatively as a case of "giggling at funeral"! People tend to conform to the norms, and refrain from expressing themselves in a way that seems discordant to the context. If my friends are unhappy, I would tend to keep my ecstatic feelings to myself, and would hesitate to express extraordinary happiness, even though I am not as unhappy within. I think we should distinguish between the terms "mood" (as a pervasive and long term emotional state) and "affect" (as a temporary and immediate expression of emotions.) These findings seem to show how people moderate their affects in different emotional contexts, rather than how ego's mood is influenced by alter's. This claim is supported by the tiny effect size of 0.06-0.07% differences in probability of using emotionally charged words. For example, the study showed that if negative content is reduced in the news feeds, the probability of using negative words reduced by 0.07% (or 7 words out of 10000 words). This by no means represent a long-term and overall change in emotional state (i.e. mood). Consistently, I interpret the observed withdrawal effect (people who were exposed to less emotional content expressed less emotions) as the lack of motivation to express emotions when the context is not motivating, and not as the case of flat mood!</p>

<p>Not to mention the discrepancy in developmental, social and professional affectations. Those studied range from ages 13 to 60-plus. A teenager may affect, say, a depressive personality as a rejection of conformity; or they may be experiencing hormonal wonkiness. A 40-year-old may vet what she or he expresses on Facebook because their employer monitors social media activity.</p><p>On the Internet, no one knows you're a dog.</p><p>And what about a post that says, "Got a new pair of Nikes. #SoHappy!" or some such. Nike's adverts for that pair of shoes are the product of social research. There's no control that can separate how much sway advertising has over a person, and account for affect by way of capital from -- in your terms -- affect by way of emotional context from affect by way of mood.</p><p>For what it's worth, I think online social media generally pathologizes narcissistic behavior in our avatars with regard to emotional affectation. Narcissism works like capitalist production: You take in the raw material; a narcissistic supply of potential followers or likers is omnipresent; and if you do it right, affecting a popular or humorous topic, out pops refined social capital -- apologies for using that beat-to-death term, but what else can we call it? Whatever the term, Using Facebook now, as opposed to ten years ago, is less about sharing the emotional details of your life and very much "get with it or die trying."</p><p>Trying to quantify something as nebulous as the labor and use values of likes and followers has few purposes, the most obvious of which is refining Facebook or other social mediums so it's easier for people to feel like they are producing something when others in their network either implicitly, with likes, or explicitly, by commenting or sharing, approve of their affectations.</p><p>Frankly, emotional contagion is a rather banal and unproductive way to assess social media when the medium's political and pathological expressions -- read: addiction and narcissism; a dual-axis affliction!--  is, and I will reluctantly say debatably, of greater social importance. I don't see any therapeutic use for this study. It's an investment. A cynical cash-grab masquerading as science.</p><p>I'd also like to see the financial paper trail. What's the dollar return on these kinds of data? Clearly, I picked the wrong career.</p>

<p>I do not understand why the editors issued an expression of concern.   They write: "the collection of the data by Facebook may have involved practices that were not fully consistent with the principles of obtaining informed consent."  But this claim is false.</p><p>This study was very clearly a 'minimal risk' study as defined by the Common Rule (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html):" rel="nofollow">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humans...</a></p><p>"Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests."</p><p>As an example, a routine blood draw would be considered minimal risk.</p><p>Since all this experiment did was to change the set of information shown in the Facebook newsfeed, and since Facebook users experience changes in the algorithm all the time, I think the only reasonable interpretation is that this study is minimal risk.  There is no evidence that the researchers did anything that exceeds risks normally encountered on the Facebook platform.</p><p>As such, it is eligible for waiver of consent, as indicated in the Common Rule.  This is exactly how we obtained IRB approval from the University of California, San Diego, for similar experiments like Bond et al. 2012 published in Nature (<a href="http://fowler.ucsd.edu/massive_turnout.pdf)" rel="nofollow">http://fowler.ucsd.edu/massive...</a>.  It is also standard practice for nearly all large scale field experiments like get-out-the-vote studies. IRBs that understand the Common Rule typically allow these studies to be conducted WITHOUT consent.</p><p>Therefore the Facebook experiment WAS fully consistent with the Common Rule and with the principles of obtaining informed consent.</p><p>The Common Rule was influenced by hundreds of people who thought a lot about ethical issues in research.  They understood that it is unreasonable to require subjects to be informed about every study.  In cases of minimal risk, consent  actually poses a net burden to subjects, creating harm where none existed before, and the generalizability of the results can be so skewed as to invalidate the whole exercise.</p><p>I implore the PNAS editors to rethink their position on this issue.  We already have a Common Rule that provides good protection for subjects, and I hope you take some time to better understand it.</p><p>If academics cannot publish studies like these, it will not end experimentation.  It will instead reduce transparency and the potential public good that results when everyone -- not just private companies -- better understand how large scale systems work.<br></p>

<p>Nonsense. It is not up to any idiot researcher to determine what is or what is not minimal risk. It is up to the IRB. Otherwise everyone would call their work minimal risk and be done with it.<br>Either you don't do research or (even worse) you apparently do unethical research</p>

<p>I have read more than my fair share of IRB documents, and please tell me how the level of "minimal harm" of an actually-inconsequential drawing of blood with the subject's full awareness equates to a study wherein the expected result is a heightening of real-life fears of a subject who does not know (s)he is being researched?  I assume you have been bought and paid for at some point, too, then.</p>

<p>In regards to their tampering being "minimal risk", my sister is struggling with some very hard emotional issues. She has liked several inspirational and mental health type  pages on Facebook to help keep her mind in a more positive place when she visits the site to talk to friends. Most of these pages have not been showing up in her News Feed as of late and it has had a profound effect on her ability to cope with said issues. I consider that more than a minimal risk.</p><p>That having been said, it clearly states in the Facebook Data Use Policy that,</p><p>"...in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you [...] for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement."</p><p>So by accepting their terms, we all agreed to this. Does that make it okay? Not really, but their asses are technically covered.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/about...</a></p>

<p>The reason your sister hasn't been seeing those posts has nothing to do with research. It has to do with facebook business model. Nowadays, if you manage a page and want your followers to see your posts, you have to pay. If that's your problem, complain about facebook business model, not about this research.</p>

<p>I'm not complaining about either, really. You must have misunderstood, I'm just making an observation. The "promote" option has been available since late last year whereas things disappearing from the news feed is a much more recent occurrence for me (maybe in the last 3 or so months). So it still seems to me that the two could very likely be related, and since I have more evidence that they are as opposed to evidence suggesting that they aren't... for the time being I'm going to remain leaning towards the former.</p>

<p>So maybe the two aren't unrelated. That being said, I don't see how this study is any different than showing users "relevant content" as opposed to what they've already specified they enjoy via the liking system. In this study the user's available content is limited and adjusted in an attempt to coerce a specific response, be it positive or negative. Likewise, in the news post by Facebook's product marketing lead, which was the reference for the article you linked, they are explaining that "Organic Reach" is also limiting available posts essentially based on what type of person you are. <br>So what happens when someone like myself, who has liked a good number of "lulz" type pages decides to also like a science and nature related page? I'll tell you; it never shows up in my news feed because it doesn't seem important enough for me, according to someone else's opinion of me, which in turn affects my mood. Facebook seems to forget that they already have a system in place for filtering content that is under the user's control, i.e the "List" feature. If a user's news feed sees 2000 posts a day that shouldn't be an issue, because they can create a list for family, religion, friends, humor, whatever; and filter their available content this way outside the prying of Facebook themselves.</p>

<p>That's debatable really.  Because what constitutes "research" when you're agreeing to a TOS for a social network? As someone who has worked in R&amp;D for a software company, I wouldn't expect it to be psychological studies and/or human studies but rather R&amp;D for web development/software development.</p><p>To use research as an over broad interpretation for anything means they can show up at your house, kidnap you, and throw you into a lab where they can perform vivisection. There's a realistic intrepration within the scope of the site and there's taking advantage.</p><p>If "research" means they own you? No one should ever sign a TOS again.</p>

<p>You seem to be missing the part where they mention using "information we receive about you" for research. I'm assuming that's how you went from "using data collection for research purposes" to "kidnapping people from their homes for research". In this case, it would seem to mean they own the data they've collected on you, and can use it how they see fit.</p><p>It's just unpalatable to me that a website, that is meant to connect people, would go to such great lengths to separate their users from content they've already expressed that they enjoy.</p>

<p>The common rule does not apply to this case, as it can only be applied to US Government research activities. In fact, the common rule, using your logic, would allow a group of doctors to (taken to extremes for the purpose of making it clear) euthanise dying people as their actions would have "minimal risk" to the general population and these people would eventually die anyway.  As for likening it to a blood draw, the subject can refuse a blood draw, in this case they subjects NEVER KNEW about it.  If someone stuck a needle in you without your consent you would be screaming assault.  Just to add to the mix, the legal authorities in the UK have called facebook onto the carpet to explain this unethical and illegal "research".<br>Justifiying illegal and unethical actions as "research" is a throwback to the days of eugenics and the abuses that culminated in the "researches" of mengele and his like.</p>

<div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto">

<p>There are several incorrect statements of U.S. law in this post, many of which have been repeated in the media, to the detriment of accurate public understanding of what the federal regulations governing human subjects research do and do not govern and, within their sphere of governance, what they do and do not allow. Whatever one's views of the ethics of this study, no one is served by premising that discussion on incorrect assertions about the applicable law. (Note: the law in other countries where <br>English-speaking Facebook users were subjects, and the ethics of the <br>study both here and abroad, are separate matters, neither of which I discuss here.)</p><p>To begin, it is not true that "The common rule does not apply to this case, as it can only be applied to US Government research activities." The Common Rule, including the requirement of IRB review, applies by law [including the terms of the federal regulations themselves and contractual agreements entered into between institutions and the federal government] much more broadly than that. Non-exempt human subjects research must legally comply with the Common Rule when it is: (1) conducted by any of 15 federal agencies and departments, (2) funded by any of those agencies and departments, (3) conducted as part of an FDA application to market a drug, device, or biological [technically not the Common Rule but the FDA's nearly identical regulations], or (4) conducted by a student or faculty member of a college or university that, in the process of at some point accepting a federal research grant for some research project, has agreed by contract with the federal government to submit to IRB review ALL human subjects research in which the institution is "engaged."</p><p>Early rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, this research was neither conducted nor funded by the federal government. However, the two academic authors were during the time of the study affiliates of Cornell (see correction to the PNAS paper clarifying this), which is among those institutions that has agreed to extend IRB review to all human subjects research in which it, Cornell, is "engaged." When an institution is and is not "engaged in research" by virtue of their affiliates' participation in a research projects depends on what, exactly, those affiliates did. The regulations themselves do not define "engaged in research," but those in charge of overseeing those regulations have issued a guidance document on this point (which Cornell has adopted), the best interpretation of which is that an institution whose affiliates help design the protocol and write up the results for publication but do not obtain data about the subjects through intervention, do not obtain identifiable private information about the subjects, and do not consent subjects  is NOT "engaged in research." Hence, Cornell's IRB was not required by the federal regulations (or, it would seem, by its own internal policy) to review this study. And Facebook is not subject to these regulations at all. As a result, U.S. law did not require any IRB review of this study. (Yes, PNAS has its own policy concerning IRB review and informed consent, but that's not a matter of law, which is what I'm focusing on here.)</p><p>Moreover, despite what you imply, it is not the case -- and has never been the case since HHS first promulgated these regulations in 1981 (adopted by the 14 other federal agencies in 1991) -- that all human subjects research that is subject to IRB review must involve the informed consent of the subjects. Lots of important research cannot be done with fully informed consent. As a result, the Common Rule has an entire subsection, 45 CFR 46.116(c)-(d), devoted to explaining when an IRB may alter the elements of informed consent that are ordinarily required and when it may waive the informed consent requirements entirely. IRBs notoriously make different decisions about the acceptability of similar and even identical protocols, and the "minimal risk" criterion at issue in 46.116(d) is especially susceptible to different interpretations, but an IRB very plausibly could have determined that this study involved minimal risk and qualified for altered, if not waived, informed consent.</p><p>Finally, although it is orthogonal to any discussion of the Facebook study, the poster below, technik1, is incorrect about how U.S. federal regulators and IRBs tend to treat blood draws. The agency in charge of overseeing the Common Rule once issued a helpful “IRB Guidebook” (see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/irb/irb_chapter3.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archiv...</a> which specifically cites "the risk of drawing a small amount of blood from a healthy individual" as an example of “minimal risk” research. Although that IRB Guidebook was last updated in 1993, and readers today are warned that “[d]evelopments over the intervening years have made portions of the Guidebook information obsolete, while portions of the information remain valid,” most U.S. IRBs continue to interpret single (or “minimal”) blood draws in healthy adults, and even sometimes in children, as minimal risk. See, e.g., <a href="http://www.research.umn.edu/irb/risk.html#.U7cC1Kjeyec;" rel="nofollow">http://www.research.umn.edu/ir...</a><br><a href="https://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/bldsamp.htm;" rel="nofollow">https://healthcare.partners.or...</a> and<br><a href="https://www.nwhealth.edu/institutional-review-board/which-forms-to-use/" rel="nofollow">https://www.nwhealth.edu/insti...</a>.<br> In 2013, the U.S. Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues issued a report describing drawing blood in children as "minimal risk." See <a href="http://bioethics.gov/sites/default/files/PCSBI_Pediatric-MCM508.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://bioethics.gov/sites/def...</a> (at p. 68).</p><p>I provide a more detailed analysis of how U.S. federal human subjects research regulations apply to this study, including citations to primary source documents, at <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/everything-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-manipulative-experiment/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/2014/06/e...</a>.</p><p>Michelle N.

<p>As a professional who supervises ethical reviews, let me clarrify:  <br>the common rule does NOT apply outside of the US or US Government sponsored research, despite your comments.  Hope that helps you out and I would point out that any ethical review submission that followed the lines of this "study" would never be approved by a an institution that I have ever been affiliated with.</p>

<p>I disagree, " a routine blood draw would be considered minimal risk." is not<br>minimal risk in a research context on a population of healthy subjects. It is<br>invasive requiring full IRB procedure, at least in Europe. You are trying to<br>water down the spirit of the Declaration of Helsinki in sentences like "They <br>understood that it is unreasonable to require subjects to be informed about <br>every study." very dangerous thinking.</p>
