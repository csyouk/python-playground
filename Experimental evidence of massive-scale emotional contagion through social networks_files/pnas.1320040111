Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2397894,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":229,"cited_by_feeds_count":85,"cited_by_gplus_count":103,"cited_by_msm_count":155,"cited_by_peer_review_sites_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":4283,"cited_by_rdts_count":12,"cited_by_tweeters_count":3295,"cited_by_videos_count":4,"cited_by_weibo_count":3,"cited_by_accounts_count":3887,"context":{"all":{"count":2274632,"mean":4.7993776951096,"rank":6,"pct":99,"higher_than":2274684},"journal":{"count":22421,"mean":13.597831578947,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":22421},"similar_age_3m":{"count":61532,"mean":6.4357178982951,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":61531},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":850,"mean":29.860435806832,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":849}},"score":4629.6719999999,"history":{"at":4629.6719999999,"1d":12.25,"2d":14.95,"3d":24.85,"4d":51.18,"5d":69.954,"6d":90.884,"1w":131.008,"1m":4466.746,"3m":4622.6719999999,"6m":4622.6719999999,"1y":4622.6719999999},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320040111","added_on":1401749948,"published_on":1401663600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1405418112,"readers_count":7,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":7},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=4630&types=msvbtrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=4630&types=msvbtrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=4630&types=msvbtrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2397894"})
